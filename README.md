## Playing with Hubot

You'll need to install the necessary dependencies for hubot. All of
those dependencies are provided by [npm][npmjs].

[npmjs]: http://npmjs.org

## HTTP Listener

Hubot has a HTTP listener which listens on the port specified by the `PORT`
environment variable.

You can specify routes to listen on in your scripts by using the `router`
property on `robot`.

```coffeescript
module.exports = (robot) ->
  robot.router.get "/hubot/version", (req, res) ->
    res.end robot.version
```

There are functions for GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, which all take a route and
callback function that accepts a request and a response.


### Testing Hubot without Campfire

You can test your hubot by running the following.

    % bin/hubot
    
Keep in mind to export any environment variables manually.

You'll see some start up output about where your scripts come from and a
prompt.

    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading adapter shell
    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/scripts
    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/src/scripts
    Hubot>

Then you can interact with hubot by typing `hubot help`.

    Hubot> hubot help

    Hubot> animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds a few
    convert me <expression> to <units> - Convert expression to given units.
    help - Displays all of the help commands that Hubot knows about.
    ...

Take a look at the scripts in the `./scripts` folder for examples.
Delete any scripts you think are silly.  Add whatever functionality you
want hubot to have.

## hubot-scripts

There will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead
of adding it to hubot itself, you can submit pull requests to
[hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts].

To enable scripts from the hubot-scripts package, add the script name with
extension as a double quoted string to the `hubot-scripts.json` file in this
repo.

[hubot-scripts]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts

## external-scripts

Tired of waiting for your script to be merged into `hubot-scripts`? Want to
maintain the repository and package yourself? Then this added functionality
maybe for you!

Hubot is now able to load scripts from third-party `npm` packages! To enable
this functionality you can follow the following steps.

1. Add the packages as dependencies into your `package.json`
2. `npm install` to make sure those packages are installed

To enable third-party scripts that you've added you will need to add the package
name as a double quoted string to the `external-scripts.json` file in this repo.
